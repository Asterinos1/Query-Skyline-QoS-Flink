# Distributed Skyline Query Processing

An Apache Flink + Kafka project written in Java for **distributed stream processing** of Skyline Queries, developed as part of the *Special Topics in Databases - COMP 622* course at the **Technical University of Crete**.

This project implements three partitioning strategies (**MR-Dim**, **MR-Grid**, and **MR-Angle**) using the **Flink DataStream API** to perform real-time dominance analysis on high-volume data streams ingested via Apache Kafka.
